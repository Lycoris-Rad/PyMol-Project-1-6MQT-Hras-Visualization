# PyMol-Project-1-6MQT-Hras-Visualization
For the first project I navigated PyMOL through UFApps, focusing on 6MQT protein structure from X-ray crystallography. I Identified and isolated "hras" chain, ensuring a streamlined visual. I employed commands like extract and color to accentuate specific elements, e.g., Mg atom in GDP binding. and meticulously addressed structural nuances, distinguishing and colorizing alpha helices and beta sheets.  Finally I Analyzed ligand (GDP) interactions, addressing key questions. relating to the generated visual image. This project reflects an enhanced proficiency in molecular visualization and structural analysis.
